        <p><span>In general, the content and services offered on the Website are purely informative in

        <p><span>The company will not be responsible at all in case of the impossibility to provide the

                lines, social conflicts, strikes, rebellion, explosions, floods, government acts and omissions, and,
                in general, all cases of force majeure or fortuitous events.</span></p>

        <p>In the event that any provision of these General Terms of Use is unenforceable or null under applicable
            law or as a result of a judicial or administrative decision, such unenforceability or nullity shall not
            render these General Terms of Use unenforceable or null as a whole. In such cases, the company will
            proceed to modify or replace such provision with another that is valid and enforceable and, to the
            extent possible, achieves the objective and purpose reflected in the original provision.</p>
