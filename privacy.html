        <br>
        <p><span><strong>4. COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>&nbsp;Whenever we request your personal data, we will inform you clearly about which personal
                data we collect and for what purpose. In general, we collect and process your personal data for the
                purpose
                of:</span></p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Providing information, services, products, relevant information, and news in the
                    sector.</span></li>
            <li><span>Sending communications.&nbsp;</span></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><span>Most of the personal data we process for marketing purposes are related to our customers or
                prospects with whom we already have, or with whom we wish to develop a business relationship.</span></p>
        <p><span>We base the processing of your personal data for the purposes mentioned above on your prior
                consent, to the extent that such consent is mandatory under the applicable legal framework. When you are
                asked to click/check "I Agree," "I Accept," or similar buttons/boxes/features in relation to a personal
                data
                protection notice, you will be deemed to have given your consent to the processing of your personal data
                for
                the purposes indicated. In this context, you have the possibility to withdraw your consent to the
                processing
                of your data for marketing purposes at any time.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span>When consent is not legally required, such action will be considered a mere acknowledgment, and
                the legal basis for the processing of your personal data will not be your consent but the legitimate
                interest, to meet your business needs and develop our business or brand image, without prejudice to your
                rights and freedoms as a data subject. In this regard, we undertake to contact you in the most relevant
                way
                regarding your needs or in response to your requests. In this context, you have the option to object to
                further processing of your personal data for marketing purposes ("opt-out").&nbsp;</span></p>

                    any time.</span></li>
            <li><span>By legal requirement.</span></li>
            <li><span>Due to a legitimate interest that is not overridden by your privacy rights, such as sending
                    commercial information either through newsletter subscription or as a customer.</span></li>
            <li><span>It is necessary for the provision of some of our services through a contractual relationship
                    between you and us.</span></li>
